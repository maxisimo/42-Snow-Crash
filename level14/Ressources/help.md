# 2nd step
We should try to debug getflag with main as we did with the `level13` executable :
```
level14@SnowCrash:~$ gdb /bin/getflag

```
It looks like protected.. disass the main to see if we can find something
```
(gdb) disass main
Dump of assembler code for function main:      
   0x08048946 <+0>:     push   %ebp
   [...]
   0x08048989 <+67>:    call   0x8048540 <ptrace@plt>

---Type <return> to continue, or q <return> to quit---q
Quit
```
The file is protected by ptrace ! we can bypass it with a little [trick](https://gist.github.com/poxyran/71a993d292eee10e95b4ff87066ea8f2)
```
(gdb) catch syscall ptrace
Catchpoint 1 (syscall 'ptrace' [26])
(gdb) commands 1
Type commands for breakpoint(s) 1, one per line.
End with a line saying just "end".
>set $eax=0
>continue
>end
```
Good, now we can disass the main again to see if there is more protection
```
(gdb) disass main

```
As in the `level13` executable, a call to getuid protect it.  
There is a lot of cmp, we can assume that the program also check the UID to know what token it have to give when we tape `getflag`. We should retrieve the `flag14` UID!  
In an new terminal we can find the `flag14` UID with the command `id`
```
level14@SnowCrash:~$ id flag14
uid=3014(flag14) gid=3014(flag14) groups=3014(flag14),1001(flag)
level14@SnowCrash:~$
```
Go back to our first terminal window who is running gdb and put a breakpoint on getuid before change the value of the register `$eax` where the value of the UID is stock.
```
(gdb) break getuid
Breakpoint 2 at 0xb7ee4cc0
(gdb) run
Starting program: /bin/getflag

Catchpoint 1 (call to syscall ptrace), 0xb7fdd428 in __kernel_vsyscall ()

Catchpoint 1 (returned from syscall ptrace), 0xb7fdd428 in __kernel_vsyscall ()

Breakpoint 2, 0xb7ee4cc0 in getuid () from /lib/i386-linux-gnu/libc.so.6
```
Move step by step until the return, change `$eax` then keep moving step by step until we give you the token
```
(gdb) step
Single stepping until exit from function getuid,
which has no line number information.
0x08048b02 in main ()
(gdb) print $eax
$1 = 2014
(gdb) set $eax=3014
(gdb) step
Single stepping until exit from function main,
which has no line number information.

(gdb) quit

        Inferior 1 [process 2291] will be killed.

Quit anyway? (y or n) y
